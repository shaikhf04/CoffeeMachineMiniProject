</p>

A **terminal-based coffee machine simulator** built in Python, designed to emulate a realistic coffee ordering experience. The system features **ingredient stock management**, **interactive user input**, and **automated billing** using the `global` keyword. Built with a modular, object-oriented structure, it also includes a **custom logger** that records user activity and system errors to a log file — making it both practical and production-aware.
